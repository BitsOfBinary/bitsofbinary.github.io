# Greg's Challenge: Introduction
Greg Lesnewich ([@greglesnewich](https://twitter.com/greglesnewich)) put out a challenge to write some YARA rules for a collection of samples: [https://twitter.com/greglesnewich/status/1630615467776786458](https://twitter.com/greglesnewich/status/1630615467776786458)

As I had seen that other's had picked [Hikit](https://twitter.com/Qutluch/status/1631078278231359490) and [Reductor](https://twitter.com/dan__mayer/status/1631739132551782400), I've decided to go for AcidBox.

Palo Alto's Unit42 released a great blog on this malware family in 2020, which is nicely laid out, and shows a variety of samples as part of the framework: [https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/acidbox-rare-malware/](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/acidbox-rare-malware/)

Over the next set of posts, I will dive into how I've written some rules for this malware family!

## Rule writing philosophy
Before I start writing some rules however, I think its worth discussing my general ideal approach/"philosophy" I have when writing rules for malware, which follow three ideas:
- Accessibility - make you rules as easy to understand and read as possible, and provide as much context as you can
- Simplicity - this doesn't mean the logic of the rule needs to be simple, but as complexity increases consider breaking out ideas into smaller rules to keep the main idea of the rule simple
- Redundancy - write rules for multiple facets of the malware you're trying to signature to have more of a chance of continuing to track it

I believe these three ideas combined can lead to rules being very context rich, clear, and effective. As such, I will be writing small, but clear rules over the next few posts.
