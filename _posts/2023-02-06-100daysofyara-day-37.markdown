# YARA Atoms - Writing rules using strings with good atoms
So what's the takeaway from this discussion of atoms? You want good atoms in all your strings, and this will be focused around substrings that are of maximum length 4 and scored according to the rules specified in the previous post. 

So to ensure you're writing efficient rules, make sure to:
- Avoid strings with very short substrings (e.g. `{AB ?? ?? ?? CD}` will only be able to use `AB ?? ?? ??` or `?? ?? ?? CD` as an atom, which are below the threshold)
- Avoid relying on short substrings of only common bytes (e.g. `{00 20}` is below threshold)
- Avoid too many partial masked bytes (e.g. `{A? ?B C? ?D}` is below threshold)

Instead, try to use strings that you know have good length atoms, and that have unique bytes.

It's okay in some instances to have strings with bad atoms in them, provided that you have good atoms to make up for it. E.g. `{00 20}` is a bad string on its own, but `{AB CD EF 00 20}` is a good string, as YARA can use the atom `AB CD EF 00`.

YARA will still work even if you have bad atom strings, but don't ignore those `string "$" may slow down scanning` warnings! Hunt down the rules which are causing issues, and see if you can fix those strings - it'll help you out in the long run.
