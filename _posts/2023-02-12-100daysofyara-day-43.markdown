# Math Module - Serial Correlation
There's still one more function used to determine "randomness" in the math module! And that is `math.serial_correlation`. This computation compares how much each byte depends upon the previous byte(s).

Whereas entropy and Monte Carlo pi had somewhat arbitrary upper and lower limits, the serial correlation will be between 0.0 and 1.0 (note: like with most of the math module output, it will be a floating point number), with closer to zero corresponding to more "random" data, and closer to one being more ordered data.

I've found in practice that this value will be negative sometimes, so that is something that might need to be considered in calculations. E.g., applying the following rule to the same random data as in the previous post using the following rule:
```
import "math"
import "console"

rule Serial_Correlation {
    condition:
        console.log(math.serial_correlation(0, filesize))
}
```

I got `-0.019990`, which feels like it's too big to be a floating point rounding error! So it's potentially worth applying two ranges checks to make sure you're not missing negative numbers.
