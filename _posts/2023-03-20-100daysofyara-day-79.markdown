# AcidBox - SSP DLL Strings - Format Strings Part 2
An alternative way to search for the format strings in AcidBox would be to look for them all in one chunk. Each string is sequential to the other, separated by null bytes to make sure they're aligned in 8-byte segments. So that rule would look like this:
```
rule AcidBox_SSP_DLL_Loader_Format_String_Chunk {
    meta:
        description = "Detects AcidBox SSP DLL loaders, based on a unique string chunk of format strings"
        author = "BitsOfBinary"
        reference = "https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/acidbox-rare-malware/"
        hash = "003669761229d3e1db0f5a5b333ef62b3dffcc8e27c821ce9018362e0a2df7e9"
        
    strings:
        // %s\%s
        // %s\%s{% raw %}{%s}{% endraw %}
        // s\{% raw %}{%s}{% endraw %}
        $ = {25 73 5C 25 73 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 25 73 5C 25 73 7B 25 73 7D 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 25 73 5C 7B 25 73 7D 00}
        
    condition:
        any of them
}
```

While this rule is stricter than the previous one, it guarantees to only hit on samples that have these format strings in order like this, making it potentially less FP-prone, at the risk of missing samples that have these format strings more spread out/out of order, etc.
