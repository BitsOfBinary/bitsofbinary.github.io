# YARA Atoms - Scoring atoms
The YARA code helpfully describes the heuristics used to score atoms, and provides some examples: [https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/blob/2b631d0ee47650923955398921c1ceccc3e38cb1/libyara/atoms.c#L117](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/blob/2b631d0ee47650923955398921c1ceccc3e38cb1/libyara/atoms.c#L117)

It is worth noting before discussing this that by default the maximum atom length (set in the variable `YR_MAX_ATOM_LENGTH`) [is set to 4](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/blob/384265e85ec1c5e01355dca8b4089aab56be240d/libyara/include/yara/limits.h#L68), and as such the code discusses examples which are 4 bytes in length.

In ascending order, the scores given to each byte in an atom are as follows:
- Any fully masked byte (i.e. `0x??`): -10 points
- Any partially masked byte (e.g. `0x0?`, `0x?F`): 4 points
- Common bytes (i.e. `0x00`, `0x20`, `0xFF`): 12 points
- Letters (i.e. `[A-Za-z]`): 18 points
- All other bytes: 20 points

An extra score is added at the end which consists of twice the number of unique bytes in the atom. There is also a hidden check which [heavily penalises atoms if all the bytes are equal and common](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/blob/2b631d0ee47650923955398921c1ceccc3e38cb1/libyara/atoms.c#L179) (e.g. `{00 00 00 00}` is worth `12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 2 = 50`, but then has `10 * atom->length = 40` subtracted, meaning it's only worth 10 points overal). 

Example scores can be seen in the docs:

A warning threshold is set to 38 points (a set value found [here](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/blob/384265e85ec1c5e01355dca8b4089aab56be240d/libyara/include/yara/limits.h#L85), which is used to compare against atom qualities [here](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/blob/2b631d0ee47650923955398921c1ceccc3e38cb1/libyara/atoms.c#L201)). Any strings with the "best" atom falling below this threshold will yield a warning from YARA, which will look like: `string "$" may slow down scanning`
