# YARA Command line: Utility - Count flag
A flag I forget about a lot is the `-c` flag (note that it's lowercase this time). Rather than displaying the rulename + filepath of each rule hit, it will instead display each file that has been scanned, and return the number of rules that have hit against it.

While you lose the context of which rules have evaluated to true against which files, it can be a useful way of getting an idea of if you're missing any samples with the rules you've written. E.g. if you've collected your samples of interest in a specific directory, and all your rules in one file, you can quickly an easily see what samples you're missing rules for/still need to signature.
