# LNK Overlay
Capability I wanted to add to the LNK module was to allow for the creation of rules depending on if data is appended to an LNK! As such, there are two variables added:
- `lnk.has_overlay` - A boolean value that is true if the LNK has extra data appended to it
- `lnk.overlay_offset` - An unsigned integer representing the offset into the LNK file of where the overlay starts (only set if the has_overlay flag is true)

This means it is possible to write rules based on looking for data from the end of an LNK file, such as the following:
```
import "lnk"

rule Heuristic_LNK_with_PE_Appended {
    meta:
        description = "Detects an LNK file that has had a PE file appended to it"
        
    condition:
        uint16(lnk.overlay_offset) == 0x5A4D
}
```

While you could equally look for strings like `This program cannot be run in DOS mode` in an LNK to try and find embedded PE files, these variables allow you to be more precise. For example, if you wanted to look for LNKs that have encrypted data appended to them, you could use a rule like this:
```
import "lnk"
import "math"

rule Heuristic_LNK_with_High_Entropy_Data_Appended {
    meta:
        description = "Detects LNK files appended with high entropy data (i.e. likely encrypted data)"
        
    condition:
        math.entropy(lnk.overlay_offset, filesize - lnk.overlay_offset) > 7.9
}
```
