# Decompiling YARA rules
As an aside, don't consider it impossible for the compiled YARA rulesets to be "decompiled". For example, Hilko Bengen ([@_hillu](https://twitter.com/_hillu)) gave a great talk on the YARA compiler itself (reference: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPRLxNq8XbQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPRLxNq8XbQ)) which included tools for [disassembling YARA bytecode](https://github.com/hillu/yara-rules-re). There is also an old (archived) project for [decompiling YARA rules](https://github.com/jbgalet/yaradec), although I haven't tested whether this still works as expected.

Why is this important? If you're using open source rules to scan files, then this isn't going to be a concern for you. However, if you're running proprietary rulesets, and assume that compiling them means they cannot be returned to source code, then that is a bad assumption. If someone really wanted to, they could go to the effort of reversing them.
