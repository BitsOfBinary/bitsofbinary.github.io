# File classification: ISO files
We've looked at some of the most common executable file formats so far, but there are so many more types of files out there that we may want to classify with YARA! One of the best resources I've seen to list a large variety of file signatures is the following: [https://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html](https://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html)

For example, for optical disk images (ISO), which have been increasingly used by threat actors in recent times, has the following description from the above linked resource:
```
43 44 30 30 31 	  CD001
ISO               ISO-9660 CD Disc Image
This signature usually occurs at byte offset 32769 (0x8001), 34817 (0x8801), or 36865 (0x9001).
```

This gives us the exact information we need to write a condition to target ISO files. We can either do this using the `uint` functions:
```
rule IsISO {
    condition:
        (uint32be(0x8001) == 0x43443030 and uint8(0x8005) == 0x31) or
        (uint32be(0x8801) == 0x43443030 and uint8(0x8805) == 0x31) or
        (uint32be(0x9001) == 0x43443030 and uint8(0x9005) == 0x31)
}
```

Or using strings:
```
rule IsISO {
    strings:
        $iso_sig = "CD001"
        
    condition:
        $iso_sig at 0x8001 or
        $iso_sig at 0x8801 or
        $iso_sig at 0x9001
}
```
