# Math Module - Intro
So far we've discussed a few different types of YARA modules, mostly around file parsing. However, there are several modules that can be used on any file type, the [math module](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules/math.html) being one of them.

It is described as such in the docs:
> The Math module allows you to calculate certain values from portions of your file and create signatures based on those results.

Personally I've found it trickier to write rules using these functions, as it may be quite circumstantial how you want to use them. Regardless, let's see what we can do with some of the available functions.

To start with, I'd recommend reading Wesley Shields' ([@wxs](https://twitter.com/wxs)) intro guide to the math module which gives some great examples and explanations: [https://gist.github.com/wxsBSD/019740e83faa7a7206f4](https://gist.github.com/wxsBSD/019740e83faa7a7206f4)
