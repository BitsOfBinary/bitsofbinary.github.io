## Note
This is a consolidated post of all 100 days of posts from 2023.

# Day 1 - 100 Days of YARA
I'm a big fan of [YARA](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara). It's a tool that makes it possible for anyone interested to write static signatures, whether to classify specific strains of malware, perform broader threat hunting, or even parsing files.

In 2022, [Greg Lesnewich](https://twitter.com/greglesnewich) started #100DaysofYARA; an initiative, similar to #100DaysOfCode, to engage with YARA for the first 100 days of the year. This can either be writing YARA rules, contributing to the source code, creating tools to help automate YARA, or generally learning more about the tool/helping teach others.

Last year, I didn't contribute to the full 100 days, but was inspired by the event to create a module in YARA to parse LNK files: [https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/pull/1732](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/pull/1732)

This year, I'd like to highlight this module and what it's capable of, as well as trying to contribute on as many of the days that I can!

![I love YARA memes](/assets/2023-01-01-always-has-been.jpg)

To start with, I'd always recommend starting by looking through the YARA documentation to see how to write rules. This is a document I spend a lot of time in: [https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/writingrules.html](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/writingrules.html)

I'd also recommend checking out [Florian Roth's guide for YARA performance](https://github.com/Neo23x0/YARA-Performance-Guidelines), which can give some good insight into why rules like the following are not great:
```
import "math"

rule CPU_Eater {
    meta:
        description = "Please don't actually use this rule, it's realllllly bad"
        
    condition:
        for all j in (0 .. filesize) : (
            for all i in (0 .. j) : (
                math.entropy(i, j) > 0
            )
        )
}
```

And with that terrible rule out of the way, we can start moving on to more useful content from today onwards!

# Day 2 - YARA Modules
YARA is primarily designed to be used for efficient string matching (which it does very well). But one of its most powerful features (in my opinion) is the ability to create and use [modules](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules.html). These can be used for file parsing (such as [PE](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules/pe.html), [ELF](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules/elf.html) or [.NET](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules/dotnet.html) binaries), utility functions to aid in writing rules (such as [hashing algorithms](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules/hash.html), or [maths functions](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules/math.html)), to help debug your rules (e.g. via the [console module](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules/console.html)), or anything you can think of that can be written in C using YARA's API!

![Available YARA modules](/assets/2023-01-02_default_yara_modules.png "Available YARA modules")

Personally, I find myself using the PE module the most, which also happens to be the most built out default YARA module. I highly recommend reading through its documentation to see what it can do, and if there's something missing then raise an issue on GitHub! There are many active contributors to YARA who will be willing to try and implement it.

I'll give some example rules using the PE module over the next couple of days to give some inspiration for how they can be used!

# Day 3 - YARA Module Example 1 - Imphash and Rich Header Hash
A simple, yet effective way of using the PE module to cluster samples is via hash values of specific components of the PE: namely, the [import hash](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/tracking-malware-import-hashing) (or imphash) and the [rich header hash](https://www.giac.org/paper/grem/6321/leveraging-pe-rich-header-static-alware-etection-linking/169729).

Both of these hash values can prove to be quite unique, and make it possible write YARA based off them. For example, if I take the SHA-256 hash `a37a290863fe29b9812e819e4c5b047c44e7a7d7c40e33da6f5662e1957862ab` from a [report by Mandiant on APT42](https://mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt42-charms-cons-compromises), we can write the following the rule which can be used to cluster further samples:
```
import "pe"
import "hash"

rule APT42_CHAIRSMACK_PE_Metadata {
    meta:
        description = "Detects samples of CHAIRSMACK based on unique PE metadata (i.e. imphash and rich PE header hash)"
        reference = "https://mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt42-charms-cons-compromises"
        hash = "a37a290863fe29b9812e819e4c5b047c44e7a7d7c40e33da6f5662e1957862ab"

    condition:
        pe.imphash() == "72f60d7f4ce22db4506547ad555ea0b1" or 
        hash.md5(pe.rich_signature.clear_data) == "c0de41e45352714500771d43f0d8c4c3"
}
```

[I've written a script](https://github.com/BitsOfBinary/yarabuilder-examples/blob/main/pe/yarabuilder_pe.py) that can generate rules from these values (making use of [pefile](https://github.com/erocarrera/pefile) which makes this parsing very straightforward!), and you can also get these values from other platforms that parse files, such as VirusTotal, AlienVault, MalwareBazaar, and so on!

So next time you are about to write some rules for a PE binary, use the imphash and rich header hash for some quick and easy rules! These shouldn't be intended to replace more rigorous rules (i.e. based on strings, code segments, anomalies, etc.), but can build in some redundancy into your detection capabilities. 

## Disclaimer
As always with YARA rules, test to make sure your rules behave as expected! Blindly using an imphash or rich header hash might get you lots of false positives. E.g., the [imphash for a .NET PE binary](https://twitter.com/cyb3rops/status/1511725863414419459) (`f34d5f2d4577ed6d9ceec516c1f5a744`) will be the same across many different files, due to them all importing the same library (`mscoree.dll`) and the same function from that library (`_CorExeMain`).

# Day 4 - YARA Module Example 2 - PDB Paths
PDB files are generated by Visual Studio for the purposes of debugging. As such, binaries generated using the `Debug` option in Visual Studio will have a hardcoded path to where the PDB file lies. This path can reveal some useful information, such as the drive/username of the user that compiled the file, or internal names given to the project.

All kinds of heuristics can be used on PDB paths (see Steve Miller's [Swear Engine](https://twitter.com/stvemillertime/status/1100399116876533760)), so it's worth trying to see what weird things you can find!

```
import "pe"

rule Heuristic_PE_PDB_Self_Identifying_as_Malware {
    meta:
        description = "Detects files that identify themselves as malware"
        
    condition:
        pe.pdb_path icontains "malware"
}
```

Note: `icontains` is an operator that acts as a case-insensitive `contains`. If you've not seen this operator, I highly recommend checking out all the [operators listed in the YARA documentation](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/writingrules.html#conditions); there are some really useful ones!

For a more practical example, we could consider the SessionManager IIS backdoor as [reported on by Kaspersky](https://securelist.com/the-sessionmanager-iis-backdoor/106868/). In the IoCs section of this report, they list the following PDB paths:
- `C:\Users\GodLike\Desktop\t\t4\StripHeaders-master\x64\Release\sessionmanagermodule.pdb`
- `C:\Users\GodLike\Desktop\t\t4\SessionManagerModule\x64\Release\sessionmanagermodule.pdb`
- `C:\Users\GodLike\Desktop\t\t4\SessionManagerV2Module\x64\Release\sessionmanagermodule.pdb`
- `C:\Users\GodLike\Desktop\t\t4\SessionManagerV3Module\x64\Release\sessionmanagermodule.pdb`
- `C:\Users\GodLike\Desktop\t\t0\Hook-PasswordChangeNotify-master\HookPasswordChange\x64\Release\HookPasswordChange.pdb`

As you can see, there are some strings across these PDBs, such as `\GodLike\`, `\t\t[0-9]\`, and `sessionmanagermodule.pdb`. It can sometimes take some trial and error to figure out which segments of a PDB path will be good to signature, but a first pass at writing a rule making use of the PE Module could be as follows:
```
import "pe"

rule SessionManager_IIS_Backdoor_PDB_Path_Segments {
    meta:
        description = "Detects the SessionManager IIS backdoor based on some unique PDB path segments"
        reference = "https://securelist.com/the-sessionmanager-iis-backdoor/106868/"
        
    condition:
        pe.pdb_path contains "\\GodLike\\" or
        pe.pdb_path matches /\\t\\t[0-9]\\/ or
        pe.pdb_path endswith "\\sessionmanagermodule.pdb"
}
```
Of course you could write a rule that looks for these strings in general within a sample without using the PE module, but the regex `\t\t[0-9]\` might not perform as efficiently on larger samples as opposed to just evaluating on the much smaller PDB path variable.

# Day 5 - Introducing the YARA LNK module
The [Windows Shell Link file format](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-shllink/16cb4ca1-9339-4d0c-a68d-bf1d6cc0f943) (or LNK) has been used by threat actors for years for malicious purposes (reference: [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/001/](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/001/))! Whether to download a next-stage payload, or set persistence on an infected system, the LNK file format can be quite versatile. It has also seen an uptick in use as part of initial infection chains due to Microsoft [disabling macros by default from documents downloaded from the internet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/security/internet-macros-blocked).

With all this combined, I wanted to [put together a YARA module for LNK files](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/pull/1732) to aid defenders in being able to triage, parse, and detect them.

The next few weeks of posts will go into detail of how to use the module, and some rules that are possible to write using it. Along the way, we'll hopefully learn some cool features of the LNK file format that will be useful to consider in general (check out [Greg Lesnewich's](https://twitter.com/greglesnewich) **#100DaysofYARA** contributions so far [to see some cool LNK rules](https://github.com/g-les/100DaysofYARA/blob/main/100DaysofYARA_2023_Week1_LNKPark.ipynb)).

## Shoutouts
I wouldn't have been able to write this module without being able to see the source code of other YARA modules, and through the variety of currently available LNK parsers to help validate my output (such as [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/TagNames/LNK.html) or [Silas Cutler's](https://twitter.com/silascutler) [LnkParse](https://github.com/silascutler/LnkParse) Python module).

Also shoutouts to [Ollie Whitehouse](https://twitter.com/ollieatnowhere) who gave me some great tips [to avoid bugs in my C code](https://twitter.com/ollieatnowhere/status/1556554996866596865) (which was very much needed!), and [Wesley Shields](https://twitter.com/wxs) for an early tip to make sure [I didn't do silly things dereferencing pointers in C](https://twitter.com/wxs/status/1483544341272576009).

And of course, shoutout to [Victor Alvarez](https://twitter.com/plusvic) and all the YARA maintainers for creating and developing this awesome tool!

## Acknowledgments
While I think the LNK module will give a great deal of flexibility to writing YARA rules for LNK files, a great deal of work has already done by others to write rules for LNKs! Please go check out rules from the following authors:
- Bart (@bartblaze): [https://github.com/bartblaze/Yara-rules/blob/master/rules/generic/LNK_Ruleset.yar](https://github.com/bartblaze/Yara-rules/blob/master/rules/generic/LNK_Ruleset.yar)
- Florian Roth (@cyb3rops): [https://github.com/Neo23x0/signature-base/blob/05ef26965be930fade49e5dcba73b9fefc04757e/yara/gen_susp_lnk_files.yar](https://github.com/Neo23x0/signature-base/blob/05ef26965be930fade49e5dcba73b9fefc04757e/yara/gen_susp_lnk_files.yar)

If you know of any other open source LNK YARA rulesets, please give me a shout and I can update this page with them! Check out the repo set up for **#100DaysofYARA** to see some further LNK rules available as well: [https://github.com/100DaysofYARA/2023](https://github.com/100DaysofYARA/2023)

# Day 6 - Installing YARA with the LNK module
The LNK is currently not included by default with YARA; at the time of writing, it is still awaiting approval to be merged in via a pull request on GitHub.

As such, if you want to test out the LNK module, you'll need to:
- Clone the LNK module branch from here: [https://github.com/BitsOfBinary/yara/tree/lnk-module](https://github.com/BitsOfBinary/yara/tree/lnk-module)
- Follow the instructions in the docs to install YARA: [https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/gettingstarted.html](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/gettingstarted.html)

The rough set of commands you'll need to run if installing on Linux are as follows:
```
sudo apt-get install automake libtool make gcc pkg-config flex bison
./bootstrap.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

You can optionally run `make check` to see if all the tests pass for YARA as well, although if you're able to run `yara --help` at this stage as see output then you'll know it has compiled and installed correctly!

The LNK module is available for any operating system, so you can compile it as normal for Linux/macOS, or use the Visual Studio projects to build it for Windows. [@r0ny_123](https://twitter.com/r0ny_123) also pointed out to me that you can grab Windows binaries from the AppVeyor builds (i.e. part of the regular CI/CD applied to YARA), e.g.: [https://ci.appveyor.com/project/plusvic/yara/build/job/wthlb30bklmlns0a/artifacts](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/plusvic/yara/build/job/wthlb30bklmlns0a/artifacts)

You can test if it the LNK module itself is working properly by trying to run the following rule and making sure there are no errors:
```
import "lnk"

rule test {
    condition:
        filesize > 0
}
```

The branch that the LNK module is on will install it by default, so you don't need to add any flags to `configure` when compiling YARA.

I'm aiming to keep the LNK module branch up to date with the [main branch of YARA](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara), so all other features of YARA will be available if you compile the LNK module branch!

## Troubleshooting
Let me know if you have any issues installing the module. Personally I've found that when compiling via WSL on Windows that the `./bootstrap.sh` command doesn't work as expected, but if I manually run the command inside the script file, that is `autoreconf --force --install`, then it works as expected!

## Any feedback on the module?
If you have any feedback on the module (whether suggestions for how it could be used, support for it being merged in, etc.) please feel free to drop a comment on the open pull request on GitHub!

I hope that the module will be merged in by default into YARA one day (or at least, optionally available when compiling YARA from source).

# Day 7 - Parsing an LNK file with the LNK module
The nice thing about the YARA file parsing modules is that you can output the populated variables by adding the `-D` flag on the command line. If you would like to test this out, and don't have LNKs to hand, then sample LNK files can be found in the `tests\data` directory of the LNK module branch (all prefixed with `lnk-`). So if you save the following rule to `test_lnk.yar`:
```
import "lnk"

rule test {
    condition:
        filesize > 0
}
```
And run the command `yara -D test_lnk.yar tests/data/lnk-standard` (where `lnk-standard` is provided in the [LNK documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-shllink/16cb4ca1-9339-4d0c-a68d-bf1d6cc0f943)), you should see the following output:

The variables printed are the ones that are set by the LNK module, in reverse order of when they have been parsed. They are a combination of fixed values (i.e. the symbolic constants defined in the LNK docs), parsed values from the LNK (either as single variables, or arrays/dictionaries), and some boolean values set about general information of the LNK.

The layer of indentation corresponds to how you can access the variable. If you want to access the `file_size` variable, you would do so via `lnk.file_size`. If you want to access `number_of_item_ids`, you can via `lnk.link_target_id_list.number_of_item_ids`.

As you can see, not all variables are set. The LNK file specification points out that many sections of the file format are optional, so don't expect the majority of variables to be set on each LNK file you parse!

If you want detail on each of the variables parsed out/available, they are documented in `docs\modules\lnk.rst` (which you'll have to build yourself or just read the `.rst` file in a text editor). I've also manually converted these docs to markdown for these blog posts (although they won't remain up to date with any changes) which you can find here: [https://bitsofbinary.github.io/yara/2023/01/05/lnk_module_documentation.html](https://bitsofbinary.github.io/yara/2023/01/05/lnk_module_documentation.html)

# Day 8 - Testing if a file is an LNK
Let's start with a straightforward rule: determining whether a file is an LNK in the first place. This is possible due to the LNK file header size and CLSID being fixed values:
![From the LNK docs](/assets/2023-01-08_shell_lnk_header_and_clsid.png)

If you are doing this with "pure" YARA, the rule would look like this:
```
rule is_lnk {
    condition:
        uint32(0) == 0x0000004C and
        uint32(4) == 0x00021401 and
        uint32(8) == 0x00000000 and
        uint32(12) == 0x000000C0 and
        uint32(16) == 0x46000000
}
```

If you're unfamiliar with the syntax used, YARA has a variety of operators to compare byte values at specific offsets in a file. These come in the form of the `int` and `uint` operators (which are both signed and unsigned respectively), and are available for 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit values. Later versions of YARA have also added big endian versions of these operators, so the first line of the condition of this rule could also be written as `uint32be(0) == 0x4C000000`.

As such, it is possible to determine whether a file is an LNK using this method, but requires you to go and read the LNK docs/keep a copy of this condition somewhere for use each time (plus it's a little verbose if you're replicating it across many rules).

With the LNK module, this same rule reduces to:
```
import "lnk"

rule is_lnk {
    condition:
        lnk.is_lnk
}
```

The `lnk.is_lnk` variable is a boolean value, set to `1` if the file being scanned is an LNK, and `0` if it isn't. As such, just validating that this value is true is enough to determine whether you're scanning an LNK or not!

(**Note**: you don't need to do `lnk.is_lnk == true`, as it is implicitly checking if it is true)

## Aside - Thoughts on file header validation
If you've been following #100DaysofYARA so far and seen [@greglesnewich's](https://twitter.com/greglesnewich) LNK rules, you'll notice that he does the check `uint32be(0x0) == 0x4C000000` to see if a file is an LNK.

I can't think of any cases where this won't be sufficient! Files starting with those 4 bytes are almost certainly going to be LNKs. It's similar to how a lot of us will write `uint16(0) == 0x5A4D` to check that a file is a PE; we're not actually checking the PE header or even validating the rest of the header itself, but just seeing the `MZ` string at the start is enough for us.

Checking both the header size and CLSID is a bit overkill for a rule's condition I will admit. However, if you want the assurance of the full header being present, then I think `lnk.is_lnk` is a lot more concise than the five `uint32` checks required.

# Day 9 - Checking LNK Timestamps
LNKs have three timestamps in their headers: creation time, access time, and write time. All of these are timestamps are in the [FILETIME](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-filetime) structure format, but for ease of use the LNK module converts them to Unix timestamps (e.g. to make them compatible with the [time module](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-filetime)).

![LNK timestamps](/assets/2023-01-09_lnk_timestamps.png)

As such, you can write rules based on these timestamps for a variety of purposes, such as:
- Clustering LNK files with the same timestamps
- Looking for anomalies in LNK timestamps

For example, the following rule will look for an LNK file that has supposedly been created after it has been accessed/last been written to:
```
import "lnk"

rule Heuristic_LNK_Created_After_Access_or_Write {
    meta:
        description = "Detects an LNK file with a creation timestamp later than that of its access/write timestamp"
        
    condition:
        lnk.creation_time > lnk.access_time or
        lnk.creation_time > lnk.write_time
}
```

And here's another one that finds LNK files that have been created in the future:
```
import "lnk"
import "time"

rule Heuristic_LNK_Created_in_Future {
    meta:
        description = "Detects LNK files with a creation timestamp in the future"
        
    condition:
        lnk.creation_time > time.now()
}
```

Or maybe, you want to look for LNKs where the timestamp has been removed:
```
import "lnk"

rule Heuristic_LNK_Empty_Timestamp {
    meta:
        description = "Detects an LNK file with a creation/write/access timestamp that has been zero'ed out"
        
    condition:
        lnk.creation_time == 0 or
        lnk.write_time == 0 or
        lnk.access_time == 0
}
```

This last rule can be written in pure YARA as follows:
```
rule Heuristic_LNK_Zeroed_Header_Timestamp {
    meta:
        description = "Detects an LNK file with a creation/write/access timestamp that has been zeroed out"
        
    condition:
        uint32(0) == 0x0000004C and
        uint32(4) == 0x00021401 and
        uint32(8) == 0x00000000 and
        uint32(12) == 0x000000C0 and
        uint32(16) == 0x46000000 and
        (
            // Creation timestamp
            (
                uint32(28) == 0 and uint32(32) == 0
            ) or
            // Access timestamp
            (
                uint32(36) == 0 and uint32(40) == 0
            ) or
            // Write timestamp
            (
                uint32(44) == 0 and uint32(48) == 0
            )
        )
}
```
This is possible to do due to the fixed offsets in the LNK header, but makes for a more verbose rule!

(EDIT: it actually looks fairly common that LNKs will have no timestamps; go figure!)

## Think about timestamps in different ways
Timestamp anomalies can lead to some really interesting rules! For example, check out [Costin Raiu's](https://twitter.com/craiu) slides from a [presentation on writing good YARA rules](https://www.slideshare.net/KasperskyLabGlobal/upping-the-apt-hunting-game-learn-the-best-yara-practices-from-kaspersky), where slides 48-50 describe how it is possible to track TripleFantasy based on an impossible timestamp in a PE.

Maybe there are more possibilities to create YARA rules for LNKs based on strange timestamp features? Have a go if you've got an idea!

# Day 10 - LNK File Attributes
The LNK file headers (and some variables throughout the file format) have flags set with each bit corresponding to different attributes. While a lot of these are more for contextual purposes, some can tell us information about the LNK file or its target, which can be used for heuristics/anomaly detection.

For example, one of the flags present is `FileAttributesFlags`, which specify the attributes of the link target. An example rule could be to look for LNKs with the `FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN` bit (i.e. `0x00000002`) set:
```
import "lnk"

rule Heuristic_LNK_Hidden_Link_Target {
    meta:
        description = "Detects LNK files with link targets that are hidden"
        
    condition:
        lnk.file_attributes_flags & lnk.FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN
}
```

![LNK file attribute flags](/assets/2023-01-10_lnk_file_attributes_flags.png)

You can find what all these values correspond to in `yara/libyara/include/yara/lnk.h`. For example, this rule would be the following in pure YARA:
```
rule Heuristic_LNK_Hidden_Link_Target {
    meta:
        description = "Detects LNK files with link targets that are hidden"
        
    condition:
        uint32(0) == 0x0000004C and
        uint32(4) == 0x00021401 and
        uint32(8) == 0x00000000 and
        uint32(12) == 0x000000C0 and
        uint32(16) == 0x46000000 and
        uint32(24) & 0x00000002
}
```

(**Note:** this bit being set appears to be very common, so on it's own may not be enough for a good hunting rule, but combined with other values could lead to some interesting ones)

# Day 11 - LNK Hotkeys
While I'm not sure how much value this will have from a threat hunting perspective, LNK files can be run via keyboard shortcuts. Maybe you find a threat actor has a particular shortcut it likes? You can track that with YARA:
```
import "lnk"

rule Heuristic_LNK_using_Shortcut_F5 {
    meta:
        description = "Detects LNKs using the keyboard shortcut 'F5'"
        
    condition:
        lnk.hotkey == "F5"
}
```

There is also a corresponding `hotkey_modifier_flags` value that specifies if any/a combination of `HOTKEYF_SHIFT`, `HOTKEYF_CONTROL`, or `HOTKEYF_ALT` need to be pressed to activate the hotkey:
```
import "lnk"

rule Heuristic_LNK_using_Shift_Modifier {
    meta:
        description = "Detects LNKs using a keyboard shortcut, with modifier shift"
        
    condition:
        lnk.hotkey_modifier_flags & lnk.HOTKEYF_SHIFT
}
```

A potential way to hunt for interesting LNK samples may be to look for ones using common keyboard shortcuts for the LNK shortcut. For example, I find myself using `Ctrl-C` a lot to copy text, so perhaps a threat actor could abuse that to delay execution of an LNK dropped to my system until I next pressed `CTRL-C`?
```
import "lnk"

rule Heuristic_LNK_using_Hotkey_Ctrl_C {
    meta:
        description = "Detects LNKs using the keyboard hotkey Ctrl-C"
        
    condition:
        lnk.hotkey == "C" and 
        lnk.hotkey_modifier_flags & lnk.HOTKEYF_CONTROL
}
```

# Day 12 - LNK LinkInfo - Part 1
One of the useful structures to signature in LNK files is `LinkInfo`. Microsoft's description can be seen below:
![Link Info Description](/assets/2023-01-12_link_info_description.png)

The first section of this structure to focus on is the `VolumeID`, which `specifies information about the volume that a link target was on when the link was created`. This could therefore give some very useful information about the system used to generate the LNK file (which may well be a threat actor's system).

An entry in `VolumeID` is the `DriveType`, which `specifies the type of drive the link target is stored on`. This could be a fixed drive, a remote drive, or even removable media or a RAM disk!

![Drive Type Values](/assets/2023-01-12_drive_type_values.png)

Here's an example rule to pick up LNKs targeting files on removable media:
```
import "lnk"

rule Heuristic_LNK_Targeting_File_On_Removable_Media {
    condition:
        lnk.link_info.volume_id.drive_type & lnk.DRIVE_REMOVABLE
}
```

# Day 13 - LNK LinkInfo - Part 2
Perhaps an even more useful component of the `VolumeID` structure is `DriveSerialNumber`, which could be used to cluster samples together generated on the same hard drive. This is one I've not seen used as much in clustering of LNK files so far:
```
import "lnk"

rule LNK_Specific_DriveSerialNumber {
    condition:
        lnk.link_info.volume_id.drive_serial_number == 0x307A8A81
}
```

It would be interesting to see how much clustering could be done with LNKs that have had other metadata stripped/modified (such as the `MachineID` which I'll talk about later on).

An example rule using this value can be seen below, which detects an LNK dropping Emotet from May 2022:
```
import "lnk"

rule Emotet_LNK_Drive_Serial_May_2022 {
    meta:
        description = "Detects an LNK from May 2022 tagged as dropping Emotet based on a unique drive serial"
        hash = "b7d217f13550227bb6d80d05bde26e43cd752a870973052080a72a510c444b5a"
        
    condition:
        lnk.link_info.volume_id.drive_serial_number == 0x1c853811
}
```

As I like to highlight, this could be done in pure YARA with the following rule:
```
rule Emotet_LNK_Drive_Serial_May_2022 {
    meta:
        description = "Detects an LNK from May 2022 tagged as dropping Emotet based on a unique drive serial"
        hash = "b7d217f13550227bb6d80d05bde26e43cd752a870973052080a72a510c444b5a"

    strings:
        $drive_serial = {11 38 85 1c}
    
    condition:
        uint32(0) == 0x0000004c and any of them
}
```

The `lnk.link_info.volume_id.data` also contains the `volume label of the drive`, but I'm not sure how useful this would be for clustering purposes.

# Day 14 - LNK LinkInfo - Part 3
The `LocalBasePath` variable which is `used to construct the full path to the link item or link target` can another good indicator. This variable will either point to the file you want to open with the shortcut, or to the binary you wish to execute with a shortcut (minus the command line arguments, that's in another variable that we'll get to later). For example, looking for a specific path:
```
import "lnk"

rule LNK_LocalBasePath_Example {
    condition:
        lnk.link_info.local_base_path == "C:\\test\\a.txt"
}
```

Or, maybe for more heuristic rules:
```
import "lnk"

rule Heuristic_LNK_LocalBasePath_in_TEMP {
    meta:
        description = "Detects LNK files with a local base path pointing at the %TEMP% folder"
        
    condition:
        lnk.link_info.local_base_path icontains "TEMP"
}
```

Generally, if you're looking for execution of non-standard binaries via LNKs, this variable will be useful for you, e.g.:
```
import "lnk"

rule Heuristic_LNK_LocalBasePath_mshta {
    meta:
        description = "Detects LNK files pointing at mshta"
        
    condition:
        lnk.link_info.local_base_path icontains "mshta"
}
```

# Day 15 - LNK LinkInfo - Part 4
In reading the LNK documentation, all kinds of structures can be seen that are otherwise uncommon, but may be useful in more niche circumstances! For example, the `CommonNetworkRelativeLink` is a structure present when an LNK points to a file on a network share.

![CommonNetworkRelativeLink](/assets/2023-01-15_commonnetworkrelativelink.png)

While I've not seen this structure in practice for malicious LNKs myself, this could still be useful for hunting purposes to find suspicious LNKs:
```
import "lnk"

rule Heuristic_LNK_Pointing_to_Network_Share {
    meta:
        description = "Detects an LNK pointing to the network share '\\\\server\\share'"
        
    condition:
        lnk.link_info.common_network_relative_link.net_name == "\\\\server\\share"
}
```

# Day 16 - LNK StringData - Part 1
Now that we've looked through `LinkInfo`, we can move to the next optional section of LNK files: `StringData`. This optional set of structures can contain five different entries:
- `NAME_STRING`
- `RELATIVE_PATH`
- `WORKING_DIR`
- `COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS`
- `ICON_LOCATION`

![StringData Descriptions](/assets/2023-01-16_stringdata_descriptions.png)

It's worth spending a bit of time on these structures, as they can contain some useful information. I'll spend the next couple of posts going into detail on these.

To start off with, the `NAME_STRING` entry is perhaps the least useful of the five from a detection/threat hunting perspective, unless you want to hunt for LNKs that have it set to spoof some specific software, for example:

```
import "lnk"

rule LNK_With_WinRAR_Description {
    meta:
        description = "Detects LNK files with a description matching that of the WinRAR"
    
    condition:
        // Process RAR, ZIP and other archive formats
        lnk.name_string == "P\x00r\x00o\x00c\x00e\x00s\x00s\x00 \x00R\x00A\x00R\x00,\x00 \x00Z\x00I\x00P\x00 \x00a\x00n\x00d\x00 \x00o\x00t\x00h\x00e\x00r\x00 \x00a\x00r\x00c\x00h\x00i\x00v\x00e\x00 \x00f\x00o\x00r\x00m\x00a\x00t\x00s\x00"
}
```

# Day 17 - LNK StringData - Part 2
The `RELATIVE_PATH`, `WORKING_DIR` and `COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS` are all somewhat related `StringData` entries. That is, they collectively describe the filename, directory, and command line arguments for the file the LNK is targeting. These can lead to a lot of useful data points from a detection perspective; particularly `COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS`.

In fact, a lot of current open source YARA rules implicitly use these fields, even if they don't target them directly. [Bart's LNK ruleset](https://github.com/bartblaze/Yara-rules/blob/master/rules/generic/LNK_Ruleset.yar) contains rules looking for references to scripting languages (i.e. in the command line), long relative paths, and references to binaries used to execute files (such as `rundll32.exe`).

Many different types of YARA rules for LNKs are possible without the LNK module, and that's a good thing! However, I hope that these fields being exposed directly through a YARA module will allow us all to be much more specific in the types of rules we want to write.

So for instance, if we want to look for `/c` in a command line argument of an LNK file (i.e. to run them command then terminate the instance of `cmd.exe`), this is currently a bit harder to specify without it potentially being more false positive-prone (and having some performance concerns):
```
rule Heuristic_LNK_Slash_c_In_Command_Line {
    meta:
        description = "Detects LNK files that have '/c' in its command line"
        
    strings:
        $ = "/c" ascii wide
        
    condition:
        uint32be(0) == 0x4C000000 and
        uint32be(4) == 0x01140200 and
        uint32be(8) == 0x00000000 and
        uint32be(12) == 0xC0000000 and
        uint32be(16) == 0x00000046 and
        any of them
}
```

However, using the LNK module, we can be more precise, and hopefully avoid looking in large files for all occurances of `/c`:
```
import "lnk"

rule Heuristic_LNK_Slash_c_In_Command_Line {
    meta:
        description = "Detects LNK files that have '/c' in its command line"
        
    condition:
        lnk.command_line_arguments contains "/\\x00c"
}
```

## Asides
- The benefit of using the LNK module is we can drop the condition using all the `uint32be` statements checking whether a file is an LNK, as the module will guarantee that the file is an LNK if the field `lnk.command_line_arguments` is present
- At the moment you can see an annoying design of LNKs in that the `StringData` fields are either unicode, or whatever the default code page of the system the LNK is generated on is. This means we have to include null characters in the string to check. While I'd like the module to convert these fields to ASCII, this could lose information that might otherwise be important. Let me know what you think about having something like a `lnk.command_line_arguments_ascii` field. Potentially another solution would be to add support to YARA for wide character string comparisons, such as `lnk.command_line_arguments contains L"/c"` (`L` is the default syntax used to define wide character strings in C).

**Edit:** I've added an issue to YARA to add `L""` as a modifier: [https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/issues/1863](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/issues/1863)

# Day 18 - LNK StringData - Part 3
Last but not least in the `StringData` section is `ICON_LOCATION`, which `specifies the location of the icon to be used when displaying a shell link item in an icon view`. This structure has an interesting case study I observed in some [research I conducted into APT41](https://securelist.com/webinars/sas-2021-learning-to-chacha-with-apt41/) as part of my job.

In some LNK files related to the threat actor, it used icon locations such as `.\1.pdf` and `.\1.doc`. While these icon locations may not point to a real file on the system, this value being present will set the icon for the LNK file being that of either a PDF or Microsoft Office file respectively. This can make the LNK file look more convincing.

I [shared the following open source YARA rule](https://github.com/PwCUK-CTO/TheSAS2021-Red-Kelpie/blob/main/yara/red_kelpie.yar) for this technique:
```
rule APT41_Icon_Location_LNK : Red_Kelpie
{
    meta:
        description = "Detects LNK files masquerading as PDFs likely used by APT41"
        TLP = "WHITE"
        author = "PwC Cyber Threat Operations :: BitsOfBinary"
        copyright = "Copyright PwC UK 2021 (C)"
        license = "Apache License, Version 2.0"
        created_date = "2021-08-26"
        modified_date = "2021-08-26"
        revision = "0"
        hash = "2218904238dc4f8bb5bb838ed4fa779f7873814d7711a28ba59603826ae020aa"
        hash = "5904bc90aec64b12caa5d352199bd4ec2f5a3a9ac0a08adf954689a58eff3f2a"
        hash = "c98ac83685cb5f7f72e832998fec753910e77d1b8eee638acb508252912f6cf6"
        hash = "a44b35f376f6e493580c988cd697e8a2d64c82ab665dfd100115fb6f700bb82a"

    strings:
        $pdf = ".\\1.pdf" ascii wide
        $doc = ".\\1.doc" ascii wide
        
    condition:
        uint32be(0) == 0x4C000000 and
        uint32be(4) == 0x01140200 and
        uint32be(8) == 0x00000000 and
        uint32be(12) == 0xC0000000 and
        uint32be(16) == 0x00000046 and
        any of them
}
```

While in hindsight I don't believe that all samples with these icon locations are related to APT41 (hence the fortunate use of `likely` in the rule description), this rule has generally been useful in finding malicious LNK files masquerading as either PDFs or Word documents. 

If you wanted to recreate this rule with the LNK module, you could do it as such:
```
import "lnk"

rule Heuristic_LNK_Icon_Location_Masquerading_as_Doc_or_PDF {
    condition:
        lnk.icon_location contains ".\\x00\\\\x001\\x00.\\x00p\\x00d\\x00f" or
        lnk.icon_location contains ".\\x00\\\\x001\\x00.\\x00d\\x00o\\x00c"
}
```

No `strings:` section needed here.

If you're interested in this research into APT41, you can find the slides, full set of YARA rules, and link to the recording here: [https://github.com/PwCUK-CTO/TheSAS2021-Red-Kelpie/blob/main/yara/red_kelpie.yar](https://github.com/PwCUK-CTO/TheSAS2021-Red-Kelpie/blob/main/yara/red_kelpie.yar)

# Day 19 - LNK ExtraData
The next few posts will focus on the final set of optional structures in LNK files, which are in the `ExtraData` section.

![ExtraData structures](/assets/2023-01-19_extradata_structures.png "ExtraData Structures")

As you can see, these consist of 11 different structures, which I'll list below with a description from the LNK docs:
- `CONSOLE_PROPS`: specifies the display settings to use when a link target specifies an application that is run in a console window.
- `CONSOLE_FE_PROPS`: specifies the code page to use for displaying text when a link target specifies an application that is run in a console window.
- `DARWIN_PROPS`: specifies an application identifier that can be used instead of a link target IDList to install an application when a shell link is activated.
- `ENVIRONMENT_PROPS`: specifies a path to environment variable information when the link target refers to a location that has a corresponding environment variable.
- `ICON_ENVIRONMENT_PROPS`: specifies the path to an icon. The path is encoded using environment variables, which makes it possible to find the icon across machines where the locations vary but are expressed using environment variables.
- `KNOWN_FOLDER_PROPS`: specifies the location of a known folder. This data can be used when a link target is a known folder to keep track of the folder so that the link target IDList can be translated when the link is loaded.
- `PROPERTY_STORE_PROPS`: specifies a set of properties that can be used by applications to store extra data in the shell link.
- `SHIM_PROPS`: specifies the name of a shim that can be applied when activating a link target.
- `SPECIAL_FOLDER_PROPS`: specifies the location of a special folder. This data can be used when a link target is a special folder to keep track of the folder, so that the link target IDList can be translated when the link is loaded.
- `TRACKER_PROPS`: specifies data that can be used to resolve a link target if it is not found in its original location when the link is resolved. This data is passed to the Link Tracking service to find the link target.
- `VISTA_AND_ABOVE_IDLIST_PROPS`: specifies an alternate IDList that can be used instead of the LinkTargetIDList structure (section 2.2) on platforms that support it.

As such, there is a lot of possibilities for detection rules based on these structures! Let's start looking into those in the next posts.

# Day 20 - LNK CONSOLE_PROPS - Part 1
The LNK `CONSOLE_PROPS` gives information on how to display the LNK to the user. [@greglesnewich](https://twitter.com/greglesnewich) has done a really cool [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/g-les/100DaysofYARA/blob/main/100DaysofYARA_2023_Week1_LNKPark.ipynb) used to analyse and write some YARA rules based on this section. In particular, he has written a rule that will look for LNKs that have set both `WindowSizeX` and `WindowSizeY` to 1 pixel, and `ScreenBufferSizeX` and `ScreenBufferSizeY` to also be of size 1, [and done it using pure YARA](https://github.com/100DaysofYARA/2023/blob/main/glesnewich/SUSP_LNK_SmallScreenSize.yar) (i.e. no modules involved!).

```
rule SUSP_LNK_SmallScreenSize
{
    meta:
        author = "Greg Lesnewich"
        description = "check for LNKs that have a screen buffer size and WindowSize dimensions of 1x1"
        date = "2023-01-01"
        version = "1.0"
        DaysofYARA = "1/100"

    strings:
        $dimensions = {02 00 00 A0 ?? 00 ?? ?? 01 00 01 00 01}
        // struct ConsoleDataBlock sConsoleDataBlock
        // uint32 Size
        // uint32 Signature
        // enum FillAttributes
        // enum PopupFillAttributes
        // uint16 ScreenBufferSizeX
        // uint16 ScreenBufferSizeY
        // uint16 WindowSizeX
        // uint16 WindowSizeY
    condition:
        uint32be(0x0) == 0x4c000000 and all of them
}
```

I love this rule, as it shows how capable YARA is without even needing anything extra. Greg is using the fact that the `ConsoleDataBlock` structure has a fixed `BlockSignature` of `0xA0000002` to "parse" out the relevant variables in a hex string (using wildcards to skip the ones he doesn't care about). No LNK module needed!

So why do I still think the LNK module is useful? First, this approach will not always be possible in LNKs using pure YARA (we can fortunately rely on `BlockSignature` values here to find the right structure). Second, even when it's possible, it requires some understanding enough about the YARA syntax (as Greg clearly does) to write a rule to take advantage of this!

## Creating an LNK with CONSOLE_PROPS
Not all LNKs come with with `ConsoleDataBlock` structure, so if we want to experiment with values we'll need to be able to generate them! The best way I've found to do this on Windows 11 is:
- Create shortcut link for `cmd.exe`
- Right click on the shortcut and go to `Properties`
- Go on the `Layout` tab
- Edit the `Screen buffer size` and `Window size` values to all be `1`

![LNK with 1x1 pixel console window](/assets/2023-01-20_shortcut_lnk_with_1_pixel_window.png)

In the next post we'll recreate Greg's rule using the LNK module.
