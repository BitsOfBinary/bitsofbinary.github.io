# LNK LinkInfo - Part 3
The `LocalBasePath` variable which is `used to construct the full path to the link item or link target` can another good indicator. This variable will either point to the file you want to open with the shortcut, or to the binary you wish to execute with a shortcut (minus the command line arguments, that's in another variable that we'll get to later). For example, looking for a specific path:
```
import "lnk"

rule LNK_LocalBasePath_Example {
    condition:
        lnk.link_info.local_base_path == "C:\\test\\a.txt"
}
```

Or, maybe for more heuristic rules:
```
import "lnk"

rule Heuristic_LNK_LocalBasePath_in_TEMP {
    meta:
        description = "Detects LNK files with a local base path pointing at the %TEMP% folder"
        
    condition:
        lnk.link_info.local_base_path icontains "TEMP"
}
```

Generally, if you're looking for execution of non-standard binaries via LNKs, this variable will be useful for you, e.g.:
```
import "lnk"

rule Heuristic_LNK_LocalBasePath_mshta {
    meta:
        description = "Detects LNK files pointing at mshta"
        
    condition:
        lnk.link_info.local_base_path icontains "mshta"
}
```
