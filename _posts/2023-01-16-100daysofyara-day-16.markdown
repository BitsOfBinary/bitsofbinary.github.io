# LNK StringData - Part 1
Now that we've looked through `LinkInfo`, we can move to the next optional section of LNK files: `StringData`. This optional set of structures can contain five different entries:
- `NAME_STRING`
- `RELATIVE_PATH`
- `WORKING_DIR`
- `COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS`
- `ICON_LOCATION`

It's worth spending a bit of time on these structures, as they can contain some useful information. I'll spend the next couple of posts going into detail on these.

To start off with, the `NAME_STRING` entry is perhaps the least useful of the five from a detection/threat hunting perspective, unless you want to hunt for LNKs that have it set to spoof some specific software, for example:

```
import "lnk"

rule LNK_With_WinRAR_Description {
    meta:
        description = "Detects LNK files with a description matching that of the WinRAR"
    
    condition:
        // Process RAR, ZIP and other archive formats
        lnk.name_string == "P\x00r\x00o\x00c\x00e\x00s\x00s\x00 \x00R\x00A\x00R\x00,\x00 \x00Z\x00I\x00P\x00 \x00a\x00n\x00d\x00 \x00o\x00t\x00h\x00e\x00r\x00 \x00a\x00r\x00c\x00h\x00i\x00v\x00e\x00 \x00f\x00o\x00r\x00m\x00a\x00t\x00s\x00"
}
```
