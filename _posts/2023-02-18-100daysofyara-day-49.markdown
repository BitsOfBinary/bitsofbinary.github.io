# YARA Command line: Performance - Timeout
If you don't want your YARA rules to run for too long, you can manually provide a timeout setting with the `-a` flag. From my testing, this value in seconds will give a timeout to **all** rules input. If you're running against an individual file, each rule will sequentially evaluate against the file, and stop if the timeout is reached. If running against a directory, then files will be processed one at a time, evaluating each rule, and will stop if the timeout is reached. 

Therefore, you may get partial results against directories/subdirectories, but the timeout will cut off all further processing once reached.

This flag is useful if, for instance, you want to run against a live system and don't want to tank the CPU for too long, but only use it if you're comfortable not getting a full set of results if the timeout is reached!
