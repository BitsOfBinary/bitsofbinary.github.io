# File classification: ELF files
What other file types can we write conditions for? Let's consider some other executable file formats, starting with Executable and Linkable Format (ELF).

This file format is used in Linux, and like PE files it has some "magic bytes" [at the start of the binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) (as seen in this example from Wikipedia):

As the specification lays out, ELF files will start with the byte `0x7f` followed by the characters `ELF`. We can write a YARA rule for this as follows:
```
rule IsELF {
    condition:
        uint32be(0) == 0x7f454c46
}
```

Note that I'm using the big endian version here, as it means I can copy the bytes straight into the rule in order. You can do a little endian equivalent using `uint32(0) == 0x464c457f`. Again, up to you what you prefer.
