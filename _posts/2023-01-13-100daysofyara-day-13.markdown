# LNK LinkInfo - Part 2
Perhaps an even more useful component of the `VolumeID` structure is `DriveSerialNumber`, which could be used to cluster samples together generated on the same hard drive. This is one I've not seen used as much in clustering of LNK files so far:
```
import "lnk"

rule LNK_Specific_DriveSerialNumber {
    condition:
        lnk.link_info.volume_id.drive_serial_number == 0x307A8A81
}
```

It would be interesting to see how much clustering could be done with LNKs that have had other metadata stripped/modified (such as the `MachineID` which I'll talk about later on).

An example rule using this value can be seen below, which detects an LNK dropping Emotet from May 2022:
```
import "lnk"

rule Emotet_LNK_Drive_Serial_May_2022 {
    meta:
        description = "Detects an LNK from May 2022 tagged as dropping Emotet based on a unique drive serial"
        hash = "b7d217f13550227bb6d80d05bde26e43cd752a870973052080a72a510c444b5a"
        
    condition:
        lnk.link_info.volume_id.drive_serial_number == 0x1c853811
}
```

As I like to highlight, this could be done in pure YARA with the following rule:
```
rule Emotet_LNK_Drive_Serial_May_2022 {
    meta:
        description = "Detects an LNK from May 2022 tagged as dropping Emotet based on a unique drive serial"
        hash = "b7d217f13550227bb6d80d05bde26e43cd752a870973052080a72a510c444b5a"

    strings:
        $drive_serial = {11 38 85 1c}
    
    condition:
        uint32(0) == 0x0000004c and any of them
}
```

The `lnk.link_info.volume_id.data` also contains the `volume label of the drive`, but I'm not sure how useful this would be for clustering purposes.
