# YARA Tip - Hex values in text strings - Part 1
Did you know that you can put specific hex values in YARA text strings?

You can write YARA rules specifically for [hexadecimal strings](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/writingrules.html#hexadecimal-strings), as follows:
```
rule Hex_String_Test {
    strings:
        $ = {AB CD EF 00}
        
    condition:
        any of them
}
```

You can write an equivalent for this rule using text strings by prepending each byte with `\x`, as follows:
```
rule Hex_Chars_in_Text_String_Test {
    strings:
        $ = "\xAB\xCD\xEF\x00"
        
    condition:
        any of them
}
```

This rule is equivalent to the one above! It can be useful if you want to have a mixture of ASCII/non-ASCII characters in a text string (and some other benefits that I'll go into tomorrow).

Thank you to David Cannings ([@edeca](https://twitter.com/edeca)) for teaching me this (among many other YARA tips/tricks over the years!).
