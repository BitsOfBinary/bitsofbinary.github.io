# LNK LinkInfo - Part 1
One of the useful structures to signature in LNK files is `LinkInfo`. Microsoft's description can be seen below:

The first section of this structure to focus on is the `VolumeID`, which `specifies information about the volume that a link target was on when the link was created`. This could therefore give some very useful information about the system used to generate the LNK file (which may well be a threat actor's system).

An entry in `VolumeID` is the `DriveType`, which `specifies the type of drive the link target is stored on`. This could be a fixed drive, a remote drive, or even removable media or a RAM disk!

Here's an example rule to pick up LNKs targeting files on removable media:
```
import "lnk"

rule Heuristic_LNK_Targeting_File_On_Removable_Media {
    condition:
        lnk.link_info.volume_id.drive_type & lnk.DRIVE_REMOVABLE
}
```
