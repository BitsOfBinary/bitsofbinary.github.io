# LNK CONSOLE_PROPS - Part 1
The LNK `CONSOLE_PROPS` gives information on how to display the LNK to the user. [@greglesnewich](https://twitter.com/greglesnewich) has done a really cool [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/g-les/100DaysofYARA/blob/main/100DaysofYARA_2023_Week1_LNKPark.ipynb) used to analyse and write some YARA rules based on this section. In particular, he has written a rule that will look for LNKs that have set both `WindowSizeX` and `WindowSizeY` to 1 pixel, and `ScreenBufferSizeX` and `ScreenBufferSizeY` to also be of size 1, [and done it using pure YARA](https://github.com/100DaysofYARA/2023/blob/main/glesnewich/SUSP_LNK_SmallScreenSize.yar) (i.e. no modules involved!).

```
rule SUSP_LNK_SmallScreenSize
{
    meta:
        author = "Greg Lesnewich"
        description = "check for LNKs that have a screen buffer size and WindowSize dimensions of 1x1"
        date = "2023-01-01"
        version = "1.0"
        DaysofYARA = "1/100"

    strings:
        $dimensions = {02 00 00 A0 ?? 00 ?? ?? 01 00 01 00 01}
        // struct ConsoleDataBlock sConsoleDataBlock
        // uint32 Size
        // uint32 Signature
        // enum FillAttributes
        // enum PopupFillAttributes
        // uint16 ScreenBufferSizeX
        // uint16 ScreenBufferSizeY
        // uint16 WindowSizeX
        // uint16 WindowSizeY
    condition:
        uint32be(0x0) == 0x4c000000 and all of them
}
```

I love this rule, as it shows how capable YARA is without even needing anything extra. Greg is using the fact that the `ConsoleDataBlock` structure has a fixed `BlockSignature` of `0xA0000002` to "parse" out the relevant variables in a hex string (using wildcards to skip the ones he doesn't care about). No LNK module needed!

So why do I still think the LNK module is useful? First, this approach will not always be possible in LNKs using pure YARA (we can fortunately rely on `BlockSignature` values here to find the right structure). Second, even when it's possible, it requires some understanding enough about the YARA syntax (as Greg clearly does) to write a rule to take advantage of this!

## Creating an LNK with CONSOLE_PROPS
Not all LNKs come with with `ConsoleDataBlock` structure, so if we want to experiment with values we'll need to be able to generate them! The best way I've found to do this on Windows 11 is:
- Create shortcut link for `cmd.exe`
- Right click on the shortcut and go to `Properties`
- Go on the `Layout` tab
- Edit the `Screen buffer size` and `Window size` values to all be `1`

In the next post we'll recreate Greg's rule using the LNK module.
