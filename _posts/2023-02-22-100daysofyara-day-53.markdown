# YARA Command line: Performance - Memory scanning
Did you know that YARA scan be used to scan the memory of a system? You don't need to necessarily aquire a copy of the memory to run rules over it; rather you can specify the process ID (PID) as specified in the usage:
```
Usage: yara [OPTION]... [NAMESPACE:]RULES_FILE... FILE | DIR | PID
```

You can limit the size of the largest memory chunk with the `--max-process-memory-chunk=NUMBER` flag (which by default is 1GB).

In practice I don't find myself using YARA to scan memory that often, but it's a nice option to have, especially if you want to test things like in-memory config extraction!
