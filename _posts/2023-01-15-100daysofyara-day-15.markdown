# LNK LinkInfo - Part 4
In reading the LNK documentation, all kinds of structures can be seen that are otherwise uncommon, but may be useful in more niche circumstances! For example, the `CommonNetworkRelativeLink` is a structure present when an LNK points to a file on a network share. While I've never seen this structure in practice for malicious LNKs myself (let me know if you have seen one!), this could still be useful for hunting purposes to find "suspicious" LNKs:
```
import "lnk"

rule Heuristic_LNK_Pointing_to_Network_Share {
    meta:
        description = "Detects an LNK pointing to the network share '\\\\server\\share'"
        
    condition:
        lnk.link_info.common_network_relative_link.net_name == "\\\\server\\share"
}
```
