# YARA Command line: Performance - Compiled YARA Rules
One of the first flags you may spot for YARA is `-C` to `load compiled rules`. Before YARA can start evaluating rules against files, it will compile them into a format that can be read by the tool.

You may have noticed that when you download/compile YARA that you have an additional binary called `yarac64` (or just `yarac`), which has the following command line arguments:
```
Usage: yarac [OPTION]... [NAMESPACE:]SOURCE_FILE... OUTPUT_FILE

       --atom-quality-table=FILE        path to a file with the atom quality table
  -d,  --define=VAR=VALUE               define external variable
       --fail-on-warnings               fail on warnings
  -h,  --help                           show this help and exit
       --max-strings-per-rule=NUMBER    set maximum number of strings per rule (default=10000)
  -w,  --no-warnings                    disable warnings
  -v,  --version                        show version information

As such, you can use this to pre-compile your rules for YARA. There are some downsides to this, including:
- the compiled rules will only work with the version of YARA that they've been compiled for
- the filesize of the compiled rules will be signficantly bigger than the original rule files
- you won't be able to YARA rules directly in the compiled ruleset

However, the big advantages come into play if you're constantly running YARA rules against samples (i.e. in some kind of automated fashion), as by compiling them in advance you are saving a lot of processing that YARA needs to do each time it is run.
