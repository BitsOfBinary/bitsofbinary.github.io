# LNK File Attributes
The LNK file headers (and some variables throughout the file format) have flags set with each bit corresponding to different attributes. While a lot of these are more for contextual purposes, some can tell us information about the LNK file or its target, which can be used for heuristics/anomaly detection.

For example, one of the flags present is `FileAttributesFlags`, which specify the attributes of the link target. An example rule could be to look for LNKs with the `FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN` bit (i.e. `0x00000002`) set:
```
import "lnk"

rule Heuristic_LNK_Hidden_Link_Target {
    meta:
        description = "Detects LNK files with link targets that are hidden"
        
    condition:
        lnk.file_attributes_flags & lnk.FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN
}
```

You can find what all these values correspond to in `yara/libyara/include/yara/lnk.h`. For example, this rule would be the following in pure YARA:
```
rule Heuristic_LNK_Hidden_Link_Target {
    meta:
        description = "Detects LNK files with link targets that are hidden"
        
    condition:
        uint32(0) == 0x0000004C and
        uint32(4) == 0x00021401 and
        uint32(8) == 0x00000000 and
        uint32(12) == 0x000000C0 and
        uint32(16) == 0x46000000 and
        uint32(24) & 0x00000002
}
```

(**Note:** this bit being set appears to be very common, so on it's own may not be enough for a good hunting rule, but combined with other values could lead to some interesting ones)
