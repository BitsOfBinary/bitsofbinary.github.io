# LNK ExtraData
The next few posts will focus on the final set of optional structures in LNK files, which are in the `ExtraData` section.

As you can see, these consist of 11 different structures, which I'll list below with a description from the LNK docs:
- `CONSOLE_PROPS`: specifies the display settings to use when a link target specifies an application that is run in a console window.
- `CONSOLE_FE_PROPS`: specifies the code page to use for displaying text when a link target specifies an application that is run in a console window.
- `DARWIN_PROPS`: specifies an application identifier that can be used instead of a link target IDList to install an application when a shell link is activated.
- `ENVIRONMENT_PROPS`: specifies a path to environment variable information when the link target refers to a location that has a corresponding environment variable.
- `ICON_ENVIRONMENT_PROPS`: specifies the path to an icon. The path is encoded using environment variables, which makes it possible to find the icon across machines where the locations vary but are expressed using environment variables.
- `KNOWN_FOLDER_PROPS`: specifies the location of a known folder. This data can be used when a link target is a known folder to keep track of the folder so that the link target IDList can be translated when the link is loaded.
- `PROPERTY_STORE_PROPS`: specifies a set of properties that can be used by applications to store extra data in the shell link.
- `SHIM_PROPS`: specifies the name of a shim that can be applied when activating a link target.
- `SPECIAL_FOLDER_PROPS`: specifies the location of a special folder. This data can be used when a link target is a special folder to keep track of the folder, so that the link target IDList can be translated when the link is loaded.
- `TRACKER_PROPS`: specifies data that can be used to resolve a link target if it is not found in its original location when the link is resolved. This data is passed to the Link Tracking service to find the link target.
- `VISTA_AND_ABOVE_IDLIST_PROPS`: specifies an alternate IDList that can be used instead of the LinkTargetIDList structure (section 2.2) on platforms that support it.

As such, there is a lot of possibilities for detection rules based on these structures! Let's start looking into those in the next posts.
