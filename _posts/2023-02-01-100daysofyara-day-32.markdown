# YARA Tip - Hex values in text strings - Part 2
A benefit of writing hex values in text strings is that it allows you to apply modifiers to these strings. For example, if you wanted to look for all one-byte XOR values of `{AB CD EF 00}`, you would have to compute those values yourself and write a rule with all 255 versions of them:
```
rule One_Byte_XOR_Hex_Strings {
    meta:
        description = "Detects all one-byte XOR values of {AB CD EF 00}"
    
    strings:
        $key_01 = {aa cc ee 01}
        $key_02 = {a9 cf ed 02}
        // ... truncated for size ...
        $key_fe = {55 33 11 fe}
        $key_ff = {54 32 10 ff}
        
    condition:
        any of them
}
```

Instead of going to all this effort yourself, and having a rule that has 255 lines of strings, you can use the [xor modifier](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/writingrules.html#xor-strings) like this:
```
rule One_Byte_XOR_Hex_Strings {
    meta:
        description = "Detects all one-byte XOR values of {AB CD EF 00}"
    
    strings:
        $ = "\xAB\xCD\xEF\x00" xor(0x01-0xff)
        
    condition:
        any of them
}
```

Both of these rules are equivalent in what they achieve/the efficiency in which they achieve it (the `xor` modifier will still have to generate and check for each variation as specified), but the second one is much more succinct and requires a lot less effort on your part.
