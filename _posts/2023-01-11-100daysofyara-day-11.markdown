# LNK Hotkeys
While I'm not sure how much value this will have from a threat hunting perspective, LNK files can be run via keyboard shortcuts. Maybe you find a threat actor has a particular shortcut it likes? You can track that with YARA:
```
import "lnk"

rule Heuristic_LNK_using_Shortcut_F5 {
    meta:
        description = "Detects LNKs using the keyboard shortcut 'F5'"
        
    condition:
        lnk.hotkey == "F5"
}
```

There is also a corresponding `hotkey_modifier_flags` value that specifies if any/a combination of `HOTKEYF_SHIFT`, `HOTKEYF_CONTROL`, or `HOTKEYF_ALT` need to be pressed to activate the hotkey:
```
import "lnk"

rule Heuristic_LNK_using_Shift_Modifier {
    meta:
        description = "Detects LNKs using a keyboard shortcut, with modifier shift"
        
    condition:
        lnk.hotkey_modifier_flags & lnk.HOTKEYF_SHIFT
}
```

A potential way to hunt for interesting LNK samples may be to look for ones using common keyboard shortcuts for the LNK shortcut. For example, I find myself using `Ctrl-C` a lot to copy text, so perhaps a threat actor could abuse that to delay execution of an LNK dropped to my system until I next pressed `CTRL-C`?
```
import "lnk"

rule Heuristic_LNK_using_Hotkey_Ctrl_C {
    meta:
        description = "Detects LNKs using the keyboard hotkey Ctrl-C"
        
    condition:
        lnk.hotkey == "C" and 
        lnk.hotkey_modifier_flags & lnk.HOTKEYF_CONTROL
}
```
