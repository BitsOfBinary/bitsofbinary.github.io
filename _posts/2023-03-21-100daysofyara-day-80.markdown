# AcidBox - SSP DLL Strings - Format Strings Part 3
Using the fact that that the AcidBox format strings all appear to be aligned by the same amount of bytes, we can create a further rule that is slightly more loose in that it doesn't require all three format strings to be present. We can do this by listing out the different orders each format string could appear next to one another, to make the following rule:
```
rule AcidBox_SSP_DLL_Loader_Format_String_Combos {
    meta:
        description = "Detects AcidBox SSP DLL loaders, based on combinations of format strings seen in samples"
        author = "BitsOfBinary"
        reference = "https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/acidbox-rare-malware/"
        hash = "003669761229d3e1db0f5a5b333ef62b3dffcc8e27c821ce9018362e0a2df7e9"
        
    strings:
        // Combinations of the following (with alignment bytes):
        // %s\%s
        // %s\%s{% raw %}{%s}{% endraw %}
        // s\{% raw %}{%s}{% endraw %}
        $ = {25 73 5C 25 73 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 25 73 5C 25 73 7B 25 73 7D 00}
        $ = {25 73 5C 25 73 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 25 73 5C 7B 25 73 7D 00}
        $ = {25 73 5C 25 73 7B 25 73 7D 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 25 73 5C 25 73 00}
        $ = {25 73 5C 25 73 7B 25 73 7D 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 25 73 5C 7B 25 73 7D 00}
        $ = {25 73 5C 7B 25 73 7D 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 25 73 5C 25 73 00}
        $ = {25 73 5C 7B 25 73 7D 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 25 73 5C 25 73 7B 25 73 7D 00}
        
    condition:
        any of them
}
```
