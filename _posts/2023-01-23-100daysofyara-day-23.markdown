# LNK TRACKER_PROPS - Part 1
An `ExtraData` section I want to focus on is `TRACKER_PROPS`; one which people who have tried writing YARA rules for LNKs have likely come up against before. The structure `specifies data that can be used to resolve a link target if it is not found in its original location when the link is resolved`. In particular, the field `MachineID` which `specifies the NetBIOS name of the machine where the link target was last known to reside` can be a very valuable IoC for writing rules for LNKs.

The NetBIOS name is used as a human-friendly way of identifying Windows devices on a network. You can find out what you own NetBIOS name is by running `nbtstat -n`. 

Luckily for us threat hunters, this field is left in by default in a lot of LNK files. This means that if a threat actor generates multiple LNK files from the same Windows instance (whether a physical device or a VM), this `MachineID` will be consistent across them if left unedited.

I've used this value several times to cluster LNK files together. For an example of this, let's take an LNK from the IoCs of a [Palo Alto blog on Trident Ursa](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/trident-ursa/) (more commonly known as Gamaredon Group) and write a rule based on the `MachineID`:
```
import "lnk"

rule TridentUrsa_LNK_Machine_ID {
    meta:
        description = "Rule to pick up LNKs used by Gamaredon Group/Trident Ursa based on a unique MachineID"
        hash = "f119cc4cb5a7972bdc80548982b2b63fac5b48d5fce1517270db67c858e9e8b0"
        reference = "https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/trident-ursa/"
        reference = "https://github.com/pan-unit42/iocs/blob/master/Gamaredon/Gamaredon_IoCs_DEC2022.txt"

    condition:
        lnk.tracker_data.machine_id == "desktop-farl139"
}
```

Of course, this rule can also be written without the LNK module by relying just on strings. In a way, this is preferable, as you can hunt for this `MachineID` for LNKs attached to emails, dropped via HTML pages, etc.:
```
rule TridentUrsa_LNK_Machine_ID {
    meta:
        description = "Rule to pick up LNKs used by Gamaredon Group/Trident Ursa based on a unique MachineID"
        hash = "f119cc4cb5a7972bdc80548982b2b63fac5b48d5fce1517270db67c858e9e8b0"
        reference = "https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/trident-ursa/"
        reference = "https://github.com/pan-unit42/iocs/blob/master/Gamaredon/Gamaredon_IoCs_DEC2022.txt"

    strings:
        $ = "desktop-farl139"
        
    condition:
        any of them
}
```
