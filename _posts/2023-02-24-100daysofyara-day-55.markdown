# YARA Command line: Utility - Negate
A really useful flag to use when testing whether your rules are working properly is the negate flag. By using `--negate` (or `-n`), YARA will return every rule that **doesn't** hit on a file.

I use this option for if I'm testing a rule, and can't figure out why a more complicated condition isn't hitting on a file. If the rule doesn't hit, I combine `-n` with `-s` to see which string are found in the file, which means I can then go and fix the ones that potentially aren't working as expected.
